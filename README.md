## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new coding challenge is released, and participants are encouraged to solve the challenges using their programming skills.

## Solutions

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Each day's solution is organized in a separate folder, with the code and any necessary input files.

## Usage

To run the solutions, you will need [Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) 0.5.1 installed on your machine. Simply import to the desired day's function in `main.mojo` and execute it with the right command line arguments.
